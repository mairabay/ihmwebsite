								The idea for the In Harmony Magazines came to me in 2015. While checking Social Media, 
								I found information about local upcoming events in the green, eco and wellness sectors. 
								I decided to add them to a calendar, to make it easier to remember the dates, locations, etc. 
								Then, I thought it might be useful to make the calendar public, to share that information 
								with others as well.
							</p>
							<p class="lh-copy measure mt4 mt0-ns">      
								From there, the idea was expanded to include news, informational and educational articles. 
								The thought of keeping it local	came after noticing that there were no publications 
								dedicated to local events and news,	focused on the green, eco and wellness sectors 
								for small regions in Ontario. It also matches the vision of "keeping it local" that I
								hold with my social enterprise (the Ten Percent Company).
